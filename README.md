Overview
This project is a Golang-based API that parses CSV files and returns the data in JSON format. The API accepts CSV files with a header row, and it assumes that the first row contains the column names. The API uses the encoding/csv package in Golang to read the CSV file, and it returns the data as an array of JSON objects.

Installation
To use the API, you will need to have Golang installed on your computer. You can download and install Golang from the official website: https://golang.org/dl/

Once you have Golang installed, you can clone the repository and run the following command to install the required packages:

go
Copy code
go get github.com/gorilla/mux
Usage
To use the API, run the following command:

go
Copy code
go run main.go
This will start the server on port 8080. You can then make a POST request to the API with a CSV file in the request body. The API will parse the CSV file and return the data in JSON format.

API Endpoints
The API has one endpoint:

POST /parse
This endpoint accepts a CSV file in the request body and returns the data in JSON format.

Example request:

vbnet
Copy code
POST /parse HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Content-Type: text/csv
